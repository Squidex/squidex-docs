A schema defines the structure of the content.

Each field can have the following states:

1. **Locked**: The field cannot be updated or deleted.

2. **Hidden**: The field will not be returned by the api and only visible in the Management UI.

3. **Disabled**: The field content cannot be edited in the Management UI. Do not use it for required fields.

You have to publish your schema before you can create content.
