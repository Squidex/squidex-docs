Clients are other applications or services that can access your content. Clients have to request a bearer token to access the content. This token expires after 30 days and has to be requested again.

You can use the the following roles:

* **Reader**: can view contents and assets.
* **Editor**: Can also create, update and delete contents and assets.
* **Developer**: Can also create, modify and delete schemas and rules.
* **Owner**: Can also manage settings and manage contributors and subscriptions.

Be careful with Owners and only use them if absolutely necessary, because Owner have access to all data and settings.
