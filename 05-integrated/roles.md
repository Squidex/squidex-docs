Roles define the permissions for your clients and contributors.

You can use the default roles:

* **Reader**: can view contents and assets.
* **Editor**: Can also create, update and delete contents and assets.
* **Developer**: Can also create, modify and delete schemas and rules.
* **Owner**: Can also manage settings and manage contributors and subscriptions.

Read more about our [permission system](../04-concepts/permissions) before you create custom roles.
